# Ivan Jaramillo

Welcome! I'm Ivan Jaramillo (he/him/his). I'm a software engineer, mechanical engineer, and materials scientist.

## Current Projects

I love to keep myself busy by learning new things as much as I can. I'm currently working on a couple of things:

* facial recognition
* lenses that reflect facial expressions

## Hobbies

The mind and body must be well-kept to function properly. When I'm not working on a project or studying, I do weight-lifting, American Boxing, Muay Thai, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

## Education

I studied computer science and mathematics at the College of Wooster from 2018 to 2022. I studied mechanical engineering and materials science at Washington University in St. Louis from 2021 to 2024.
