### What Up

I'm Ivan Jaramillo (he/him/his), a software engineer, mechanical engineer, and scientist. I'm currently working on a couple of things:

* text generation using a recurrent neural network.

* a Halloween costume.

* a tiny robot that walks around.

I studied computer science and mathematics at the College of Wooster and am now studying mechanical engineering and materal science at Washington University in St. Louis. I'm currently learning electronics and app development. If I'm not coding or doing maths, I'm at the gym or skateboarding. Hit me up on LinkedIn.
