### What Up

I'm Ivan Jaramillo (he/him/his), a software engineer and mechanical engineer. 
I'm currently working on two things:

* a calculator that handles simple arithmetic, but I'd like to make it be 
  able to handle linear systems.

* a small walking robot.

I'm studying at the College of Wooster where I'm majoring in computer science, 
and am part of the pre-engineering program where I should be studying at 
Washington University in St. Louis where I'll be majoring in mechanical 
engineering. To keep my work interests as general as possible, I would *love* 
to work on rockets, prosthetics, and artificial intelligence.

I'm currently learning combinatorics and graph theory, electronics, and app 
development. If you can't find me in class, I'm at the gym or skateboarding. 
Feel free to reach me via email (ivandavilajaramillo@gmail.com).
