### What Up

I'm Ivan Jaramillo (he/him/his), a software engineer and mechanical engineer. 
I'm currently working on three things:

* a neural network aimed at tackling text generation.

* a small robot that walks around.

* a glowing cube the size of your palm.

I'm studying at the College of Wooster where I'm majoring in computer science, 
and am part of the pre-engineering program where I should be studying at 
Washington University in St. Louis where I'll be majoring in mechanical 
engineering. To keep my work interests as general as possible, I would *love* 
to work on rockets, prosthetics, and artificial intelligence.

I'm currently learning combinatorics and graph theory, electronics, and app 
development. If I'm not coding or doing maths, I'm at the gym or skateboarding.
